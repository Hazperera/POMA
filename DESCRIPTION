Description: 
    POMA introduces a structured, reproducible and easy use workflow for the visualization, preprocessement, 
    exploratory and statistical analysis of mass spectrometry data. The main aim of POMA is to enable a flexible 
    data cleaning and statistical analysis processes in one comprehensible and easy use R package. This package also 
    offers a Shiny app user interface that implements all POMA functions.
