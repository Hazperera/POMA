Description: 
    A structured, reproducible and easy-to-use workflow for the visualization, pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, 
    and statistical analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data. The main aim of POMA is to enable a flexible data cleaning and 
    statistical analysis processes in one comprehensible and user-friendly R package. This package also has a Shiny app 
    version that implements all POMA functions. See https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/POMAShiny.
