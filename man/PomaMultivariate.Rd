\arguments{
\item{data}{A MSnSet object. First \code{pData} column must be the subject group/type.}

\item{method}{A multivariate method. Options are: "pca", "plsda" and "splsda".}

\item{components}{Numeric. Number of components to include in the model. Default is 5.}

\item{center}{Logical that indicates whether the variables should be shifted to be zero centered. Default is FALSE.}

\item{scale}{Logical that indicates whether the variables should be scaled to have unit variance before the analysis takes place. Default is FALSE.}

\item{load_length}{Numeric between 1 and 2. Define the length of biplot loadings. Default is 1.}

\item{ellipse}{Logical that indicates whether a 95\%CI ellipse should be plotted in scores plot. Default is TRUE.}

\item{validation}{(Only for "plsda" and "splsda" methods) Validation method. Options are "Mfold" and "loo".}

\item{folds}{(Only for "plsda" and "splsda" methods) Numeric. Number of folds for Mfold validation method (default is 5). If the validation method is loo, this value will become to 1.}

\item{nrepeat}{(Only for "plsda" and "splsda" methods) Numeric. Number of iterations for the validation method selected.}

\item{num_features}{(Only for "splsda" method) Numeric. Number of variables selected to discriminate groups.}
